# Facial-Keypoint-Detection
 ---
 
 ## Project Overview
 This repository contains project files for Computer Vision. It combine knowledge of Computer Vision Techniques and Deep learning Architectures to build a facial keypoint detection system that takes in any image with faces, and predicts the location of distinguishing keypoints on each face. Facial keypoints include points around the eyes, nose, and mouth on a face and are used in many applications (facial tracking, facial pose recognition, facial filters, and emotion recognition).

## Example
 - Input images from data set.

 ## Model Architecture
 Deep residual networks like the popular ResNet-50 model is a convolutional neural network (CNN) that is 50 layers deep. A Residual Neural Network (ResNet) is an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) of a kind that stacks residual blocks on top of each other to form a network. The architecture of RESNET50 is shown:
